We can notice that without newline character buffer for stdout was not cleared, therefore, out out was twice Hello\n (from parent and from child).
While in second case, first output happened before fork() and, thus, buffer was empty at fork() which results in two empty lines.
The only explanation for this is that stdout was using a line buffering in both cases <-> buffered was output and cleared only when newline characer met.
