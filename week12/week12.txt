COPY WITHOUT O_SYNC:
real	0m0.002s
user	0m0.002s
sys	0m0.000s

COPY WITH O_SYNC:
real	0m0.008s
user	0m0.002s
sys	0m0.000s

We can see that using O_SYNC flag increased elapsed time, yet neither user or kernel mode time increased.
Reason for this is that during writing write() blocks execution until all data is on disk, therefore making I/O synchronized.
